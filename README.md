### Project Overview

 We have a data set of a particluar IPL match played between two teams
Based on the data, we have can get to know which particular batsman scored how many runs, who scored the max sixes, how many extras were bowled, who all got bowled out and so.


### Learnings from the project

 The biggest take away from this project is that I could take is that however bigger is the data, we can always break it down as per our convenience and then once we get to knwo what exactly we want from it, the function to use are pretty basic.



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 My approach was to find out the exact key words we want to know, break it down to that list or dictionary and then go looping or whichever funciton yo find it easy


### Challenges faced

 Being new to coding and python, I was getting stuck at errors such as Indentation, syntax, etc
Also I was able to find out the answer I am looking for, but somewhow it was little difficut to put it up in coding.


### Additional pointers

 I would just say that, there is absolutely no need to worry if at all the data is huge or lookd complicated, just iterate over the list/dictionary/tuples and break it down in parts and you'll find the exact answer you are looking for.
